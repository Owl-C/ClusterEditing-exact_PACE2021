# Cluster Editing Pace 2021

This repository contains an exact solution to the cluster editing problem. The program is submitted to the  [PACE Challenge 2021](https://pacechallenge.org/2021/).  
The goal of the cluster editing problem is to make the fewest changes to the edge set of an input graph such that the resulting graph is a disjoint union of cliques.

## Compilation & Usage

The whole program is divided into several files, so build it using cmake. You can use it as follows:

```
cd build
cmake ..
make
./Main
```

The input graph is given via the standard input.
